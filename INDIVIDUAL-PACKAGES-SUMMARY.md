# Individual Packages Summary

Loom Design System now supports individual component packages for both React and React Native, providing maximum flexibility and optimal bundle sizes.

## 🎯 What Was Created

### React Individual Packages
- **40+ Individual Component Packages** - Each React component is now its own npm package
- **Meta Package** - `@loom/react` re-exports all components
- **Build & Publish Scripts** - Automated scripts for building and publishing
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Installation and usage guides

### React Native Individual Packages
- **28+ Individual Component Packages** - Each React Native component is now its own npm package
- **Meta Package** - `@loom/react-native` re-exports all components

## 📚 Documentation Created

- **`INDIVIDUAL-PACKAGES.md`** - React individual packages guide
- **`REACT-NATIVE-INDIVIDUAL-PACKAGES.md`** - React Native individual packages guide
- **`INDIVIDUAL-PACKAGES-SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document
- **Individual READMEs** - Each package has its own documentation

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Dramatically Smaller Bundle Size** - Install only what you need
2. **Better Tree Shaking** - Unused components are automatically excluded
3. **Faster Builds** - Less code to process
4. **Selective Updates** - Update individual components without affecting others
5. **Better Performance** - Reduced JavaScript payload
6. **Platform Optimization** - Components optimized for specific platforms
7. **Flexible Installation** - Choose between individual or complete packages

## 🔄 Migration Path

### Existing Users
- Continue using complete packages (no breaking changes)
- Gradually migrate to individual packages
- Mix and match as needed

### New Users
- Start with individual packages for optimal bundle size
- Use complete packages for rapid prototyping
- Choose platform-specific packages (React vs React Native)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the Packages** - Build and test individual packages
2. **Publish to npm** - Use the publish scripts when ready
3. **Update Documentation** - Create platform-specific guides
4. **Create Examples** - Build example apps for both platforms
5. **Community Feedback** - Gather feedback from users
